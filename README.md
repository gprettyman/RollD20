# RollD20
A die roller I made for a Dungeons and Dragons night that I forgot my dice.


Extra features to add:
1) Exception handling/errors for various wrong inputs
2) Clean up dice choice component (How often do I roll die that are of different types/faces? Just percentile?)
3) Add ability to set-up and save dice/modifier combinations for various moves (ie. save a 3d6+2 roller for an attack move, etc.). Type keyword to roll instad of continuing to the reroll.
